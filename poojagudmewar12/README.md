### Project Overview

 The Spy Games is a very interesting project which allows you to access data from multiple files, perform multiple techniques & methods to extract file data differently in each file and creating meaningful secreat message of it.



### Learnings from the project

 I learnred, how to apply knowledge in real time scenarios.
I learned technical skills such as defining functions, File I/O operations, using lambda function, higher level functions, data manipulation.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I first read problem statements, create a map in mind about what is expected, what solution to provide, wghat are the multiple ways to solve problem and which way I'm going to choose to resolve problem. 


### Challenges faced

 Though I have learned about some functions, sometimes we face syntax issue. Whenever I face such issue, I simply go to google and search for solutions.


### Additional pointers

 I would like to highlight here, in general file i/o operations are just learned theoretically but hand-on occurs very less times. 
Greyatom's this Spy Games project is very beautifully planned. It covers almost all the important topics such as defining functions in dirrent ways, File I/O operations etc. It was very helpfull in revising the concepts and to execute as well.
