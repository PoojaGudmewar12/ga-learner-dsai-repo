### Project Overview

 Project name : Student Management System. 
This project gives solution for managing student data, from collecting student names, their scores in all exams, calculate percentage,  find topper to preparing certificate for scholars who topped in exam.


### Learnings from the project

 This is an introductory project which explodes my abilitities to work with Python. Cleared python basics concepts.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 My approch was to remind all concepts that I'hv learnt and try to implement it. Try  to find soltion for a problem using different methods, know the difference between each menthod and its working principle behind the screen. 


### Challenges faced

 Sometimes, we think about solutions that will work, but it gives different output than we expected. Whenever I faced such issue, I took help of google to find appropriate approch to problem statement and revised my notes that I have preapred while learning and noted down new things that I found interesting.


### Additional pointers

 There is a big difference between knowing things therotically and actually working on projects. So always good to have hand-on while learning.
